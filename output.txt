AIR6001 AI and Applications
MDS6105 Advanced AI

Spring 2023

This course is more relevant than ever given the recent surge in Artificial Intelligence technologies.
It introduces the fundamental concepts, history, and advanced technologies of AI in various applications, 
providing students with a comprehensive understanding of this rapidly evolving field. 
The course covers basic concepts of AI, such as intelligent agents, problem-solving, 
search, and first-order logic. It also delves into fundamental AI technologies, including regression,
pattern recognition, sequential modeling, data mining, deep learning, and supervised modeling. 
Additionally, the course explores technologies used in various AI applications, such as anomaly detection, 
edge AI, image processing, speech processing, natural language processing (including machine translation 
and dialogue modeling), scientific paper analysis, AI in healthcare, autonomous driving, and DNN interpretability and bias.

Prerequisites

Proficiency in LaTex:  All the reports need to be written by using LaTex. A template will be
provided. If you are not familiar with LaTex, please learn from the tutorial in advance.

Proficiency in GitHub:  All the source codes need to be submitted in GitHub. 
Proficiency in Python: All the assignments will be in Python (using Numpy and PyTorch). 
Basic machine learning knowledge:  It is possible to take this course without any machine
learning knowledge, however, the course will be easier if you have foundations of machine learning.

Basic Concepts of probability:  It will be easier for you to understand some lectures if you
know basics of probability.
