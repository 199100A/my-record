AIR6001 AI and Applications
MDS6105 Advanced AI

Spring 2023

This course is more relevant than ever given the recent surge in Artificial Intelligence technologies.
It introduces the fundamental concepts, history, and advanced technologies of AI in various applications, 
providing students with a comprehensive understanding of this rapidly evolving field. 
The course covers basic concepts of AI, such as intelligent agents, problem-solving, 
search, and first-order logic. It also delves into fundamental AI technologies, including regression,
pattern recognition, sequential modeling, data mining, deep learning, and supervised modeling. 
Additionally, the course explores technologies used in various AI applications, such as anomaly detection, 
edge AI, image processing, speech processing, natural language processing (including machine translation 
and dialogue modeling), scientific paper analysis, AI in healthcare, autonomous driving, and DNN interpretability and bias.

Course Information

This course is designed for students interested in artificial intelligence. The first half mainly covers 
the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, and the second half focuses on the applications of artificial 
intelligence in various fields.

In particular, the topics include:

AI History
Intelligent Agents
Deep Learning
Image Processing
Natural Language Processing
Speech Processing
Diallogue
AI applications in Health and Self-driving Car, etc.

Prerequisites

Proficiency in LaTex:  All the reports need to be written by using LaTex. A template will be
provided. If you are not familiar with LaTex, please learn from the tutorial in advance.

Proficiency in GitHub:  All the source codes need to be submitted in GitHub. 
Proficiency in Python: All the assignments will be in Python (using Numpy and PyTorch). 
Basic machine learning knowledge:  It is possible to take this course without any machine
learning knowledge, however, the course will be easier if you have foundations of machine learning.

Basic Concepts of probability:  It will be easier for you to understand some lectures if you
know basics of probability.

Assignment 1 (10%): Lecture 1 - Lecture 6
Assignment 2 (10%): Lecture 7 - Lecture 11
Assignment 3 (10%): Lecture 12 - Lecture 26

Midterm exam (30%)
(TBD) We will have a mid-term exam after lecture 14. The scope of the mid-term exam is from lecture 1 to
lecture 14. 

Final exam (35%)
(TBD) We will have a final exam on TBD. The scope of the final exam is from lecture 1 to lecture 28.

Participation (5%)
(TBD)Here are some ways to earn the participation credit, which is capped at 5%. 

Attending Guest lectures: In the second half of the course, we have four invited speakers. We
encourage students to attend the guest lectures and participate in Q&A. All students get 0.75% per
guest lecture (in total 3%) for either attending in person, or by writing a guest lecture report if
they attend remotely or watch the recording.  -->
Completing feedback surveys: We will send out two feedback surveys during the semester to
improve the course. All students get 0.5% per survey (in total 1%) for completing the surveys. -->
Course and Teaching Evaluation (CTE): The school will send requests for CTE to all students.
The CTE is worth 1% credit.
Slack participation: The top 10 contributors (10 from CSC3100 and 10 from MDS6002) to slack will get 1%; others will get credit in propotion to the 10th contributor. 
-->
Volunteer credit (1%): TAs/instuctor can nominate students for a volunteer credit for those
who help the poster session organization, or help answer questions from other students (not writing
assignments).  -->

Late Policy
The penalty is 0.5% off the final course grade for each late day.
